# Browser Extension for manuscriptorium.com

Firefox extension enhancing the [Manuscriptorium.com digital library](http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/index.php)
with keyboard controls.
(Works only on the book page view.)

* `left arrow key` - go to the previous page
* `right arrow key` - go to the next page
* `up arrow key` or `f` - maximize facsimile view window
* `escape` - close facsimile view window
* `+` - zoom in
* `-` - zoom out

For now this extension has only been published as source on Github.
Created mainly for myself as a productivity hack.
